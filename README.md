# Bike2day

This is an app for casual bikers like myself to use in their day to day bike adventures. 

Bike2day allows its users to discover nearby bike trails and also check current weather conditions so that they can
easily plan their next excursion all in one convenient app.

The app uses the **OpenWeather** and **MapBox** APIs, along with the **React** framework.
